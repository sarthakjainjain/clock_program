# clock_program
i have created a small and easy clock program with the help of c language
if you are using compilter like dev c++ or visual studio code then there is no problem to run the code
but if you are using the turbo c++ compiler use conio.h header file instead of windows.h or unistd.h and replace system("cls") with clrscr(); also add getch() before return 0 of the program.
At last the program is simple and easy for beginners also.
